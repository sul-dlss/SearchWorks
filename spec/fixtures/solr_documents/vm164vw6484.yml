  poses an increasingly urgent security challenge that incentivizes cooperation between
  Israel and Arab states. Yet even when these national interests converge, cooperation
  remains rare due to political opposition, legal constraints, and barriers to implementation.
  This thesis investigates how states overcome these hurdles by instrumentalizing
  firms as tools of diplomacy. The analysis draws on three cases of Israeli-Arab water
  and energy cooperation between 2016 and 2023 across varying diplomatic contexts.
  Based on thirty-five semi-structured interviews with government officials, corporate
  executives, and civil society actors, alongside analysis of official documents and
  media coverage, I develop a typology of how states utilize firms to enable diplomatic
  breakthroughs. First, as political buffers, states utilize firms to frame politically
  contentious state-to-state cooperation as private sector agreements, allowing governments
  to manage domestic opposition and bypass institutional constraints. Second, as political
  firewalls, states use firms to structure agreements in a manner that preserves necessary
  political and legal distance. This function is particularly relevant when diplomatic
  relations between states are absent. Finally, as communication intermediaries, firms
  (particularly those that are state-owned) offer channels for political exchange
  between negotiating parties. These mechanisms have gained renewed relevance in the
  wake of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, which has made overt Arab cooperation with Israel
  more politically costly even as incentives for cross-border diplomacy persist. In
  this context, firms offer states a mechanism to overcome political constraints,
  enabling cooperation on matters related to national security. Hechtman, J. (2025).
