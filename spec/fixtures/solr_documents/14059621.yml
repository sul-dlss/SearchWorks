  The book furthers creative and historical material Strom first explored in her books
  You Will Always Be Someone From Somewhere Else and We Were Meant To Be a Gentle
  People while simultaneously exploring new directions, modes and fragments. The companion
  album to Instrument, Traveler''s Ode is an interwoven series of textured, ethereal
  song-poems. Atmospheric yet weighted, minimalist yet lush, the album combines voice,
  electronics, piano, guitars, and field recordings to create a deeply emotive song-cycle
  that explores haunting themes of displacement and diaspora. Echoing the work of
  artists like Tara Jane O''Neil, Grouper, Black Belt Eagle Scout, and Tiny Vipers,
  Traveler''s Ode is at the same time entirely itself."--Publisher''s website (viewed
  March 23, 2021) "Dao Strom is an artist who works with three "voices"--written,
  sung, visual--to explore hybridity and contemplate the intersection of personal
  and collective histories. Using practices of polyvocality, fragmentation, and (re)assemblage,
  Strom writes arrangements of poetry, music, image, song and sound, to be experienced
  as performance, installation, multimedia, recordings, and inside the spaces of a
  book. Strom is the author of a bilingual poetry/art book, You Will Always Be Someone
  From Somewhere Else, (Hanoi: AJAR, 2018), a hybrid-form memoir, We Were Meant To
  Be a Gentle People, with song-cycle, East/West, and two books of fiction. She is
  a recipient of a 2016 Creative Capital Award and a 2020 Oregon Literary Arts Career
  Fellowship. She has received support from RACC, Precipice Fund, Oregon Arts Commission,
  NEA, and others."--Publisher''s website (viewed August 12, 2021) American poetry

  with song-cycle, East/West, and two books of fiction. She is a recipient of a 2016
