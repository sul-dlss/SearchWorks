      developed computer music as an academic field and ushered in the era of digital
      music.    In the 1960s, a team of Stanford musicians, engineers, computer scientists,
      and psychologists used computing in an entirely novel way: to produce and manipulate
      sound and create the sonic basis of new musical compositions. This group of
      interdisciplinary researchers at the nascent Center for Computer Research in
      Music and Acoustics (CCRMA, pronounced "karma") helped to develop computer music
      as an academic field, invent the technologies that underlie it, and usher in
      the age of digital music. In The Sound of Innovation, Andrew Nelson chronicles
      the history of CCRMA, tracing its origins in Stanford''s Artificial Intelligence
      Laboratory through its present-day influence on Silicon Valley and digital music
      groups worldwide.     Nelson emphasizes CCRMA''s interdisciplinarity, which
      stimulates creativity at the intersections of fields; its commitment to open

      outsized influence on the emergence of digital music came from the intertwining
      of these three modes, which brought together diverse supporters with different
      aims around a field of shared interest. Nelson thus challenges long-standing
      assumptions about the divisions between art and science, between the humanities
      and technology, and between academic research and commercial applications, showing
      how the story of a small group of musicians reveals substantial insights about
      innovation.     Nelson draws on extensive archival research and dozens of interviews
      with digital music pioneers; the book''s website provides access to original
