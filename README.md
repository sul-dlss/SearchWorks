# SearchWorks

This is the codebase for the SearchWorks redesign.

## Local Installation

You'll need common dependencies for building rails applications such as a javascript runtime (e.g. v8).  If you don't want to have the mysql gem installed for local development you can run the bundle install command below with the `--without production deployment` flag

After cloning the repository

    $ bundle install
    $ rake searchworks:install

The installation script will

1. Migrate the database
2. Download jetty to the rails root if does not already exist.
3. Unzip the downloaded jetty
4. Copy over local solr configuration and schema
5. Index the local development/test fixtures

You will need to update the configuration in `config/settings.yml` for various parts of the app to work.  Please check that file for more information.

Start jetty

    $ rake jetty:start

or

    $ cd jetty
    $ java -jar start.jar

Start the rails app

    $ rails s

## Testing

There are two testing tasks: `rake ci` and `rake jenkins`

#### ci

This is intended for running tests against the fixtures in the local index.

    $ rake ci

#### jenkins

This is intended for running production data integration tests against the remote index.

    $ TEST_SOLR_URL=http://example-solr.stanford.edu:8983/solr rake jenkins
