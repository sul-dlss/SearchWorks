##
# A class to model a set of IP ranges.  The default IPAddr library in ruby
# can define broad IP ranges (e.g. 172.12.0.0/16 would define 172.12.*.*)
# but doesn't handle custom ranges as well (e.g. 172.22.24.* - 172.22.255.*)
# This class allows you to check if a given IP is in a network of IP ranges.
#
# There is a network of IP ranges injected by default, but an object can be
# injected that provides an array of singleton IP addresses (or ranges defined
# by the slash prefixes) and an mutli-dimensional array of custom IP ranges.
# Example network definition:
# example_network = OpenStruct.new(
#   singletons: ['172.12.0.0/16'],
#   ranges: [['172.12.12.0', '172.12.56.255']]
# )
#
# Example Usage:
# IPRange.includes?('172.12.52.21')
# => false
# IPRange.new('172.12.52.21', example_network).includes?
# => true
